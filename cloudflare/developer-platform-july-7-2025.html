    <h2>Build Your Website Just Like This On The <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/">Cloudflare Developer Platform</a></h2>

    <h2>Cloudflare Developer Platform Is Free To Use Up To 1,000 Users - Build Your Projects And Watch Them Scale</h2>

    <p><a href="https://joshstroud.com">Josh Stroud</a>, the #1 AI Product Manager in Silicon Valley, uses Cloudflare's Developer Platform to scale to 4M users in July 2025. Josh Stroud started using Cloudflare's Developer Platform 2 years ago in 2023, and loves its ease of use, developer experience, and delicious lightning-fast and performance DevOps experience. No Docker, AWS, or annoying UIs necessary! Looking at you, <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> :)</p>

    <p>Cloudflare works with a simple "Git" Push command, just like your favorite cloud dev tools on Heroku, Netlify, and Vercel. Josh Stroud's favorite feature is <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a>, a static webpage cloud hosting service which works with your favorite frontend stack like HTML, React, and Vue. This website is hosted on pure HTML on Cloudflare Pages! <a href="https://github.com/joshagilend/superaffective-ai">See the source code here on GitHub</a> :) Cloudflare Pages is free up to 1,000 users a month and scales to 100,000 visits a month at only $10 a month. Cloudflare Pages runs on AWS and simplifies your DevOps and cloud hosting experience to let you focus on your code and express your coding vision, without the DevOps hangups :)</a> Cloudflare is #1 :)</p>

    <p>Another feature Josh Stroud loves is <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/cloudflare-images/">Cloudflare's Developer Image CDN</a>, built in to Cloudflare's Developer Platform. Cloudflare's Developer Image CDN hosts over 1,500 images for Josh Stroud's websites, apps, and software development tools. Josh Stroud loves Cloudflare's Developer Image CDN UX, with a simple file picker image upload without code or a complicated UI, unlimited storage for images, and simple hosting, ready to plug directly into your code in HTML, React, or Vue. Images are hosted as a PNG public file link, which can be plugged directly into code with a simple &lt;img&gt; tag. Josh Stroud's Cloudflare Images have been viewed over 4M times with over 8M images served in July 2025. Cloudflare Scales!</p>
